TV-parse

========

Scrapes online hockey schedule and sends me an email if my favorite team is on a TV channel I have.

========

Does a web scrape and puts updated TV schedule into a database.

If the following conditions are met, a user receives an email alert:
1) the user has subscribed to receive updates for a team,
2) that team is on a TV station that I have.

Very useful when your favorite hockey team is on the other side of the country and only 
on a regional TV station that I get a few times a year. This makes sure I don't miss it!

========

Built sometime in 2012. I don't use it anymore. Not even sure if it still works.
